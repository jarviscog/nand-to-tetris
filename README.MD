# What is it?

NAND to Tetris is a challenge/project where you construct a computer from the basics. If you've ever felt like you wanted a better feel for how the levels of abstraction work going from logic gates, to the ALU to the CPU and onwards to compilers and fully-fledged OO languages, then this is the project for you!

Many of the lower-level lessons focous on systems that are taught in electrical/computer engineering, with a lot of the higher-level lessons focusing on more computer science related topics, such as compilers and OO languages.
